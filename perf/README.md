# Performance Data Collection

One of the purposes of Indaleko is to allow collection of
performance data, which is used to evaluate the costs of this
implementation of a unified personal index (UPI) service.

This submodule is related to providing a uniform framework for
data collection.

This includes a distinct collection in ArangoDB for this data,
the ability to collect data from multiple sources, identify the
machine on which the performance data was captured, and normalize
the data to simplify performance.
