Replayed message:
I've been working on this project for several years.  The code base that is in the directory to which you have access has a large code base.  Today I am working on getting the query tool (query/cli.py) working again.  I think another AI coding agent started adding facets to it and didn't finish the job (or test it) so I'm cleaning that up and I was hoping to use you as a buddy programmer.  I know it's not as fun as building a new system, but queries are at the heart of this project.

Replayed message:
Indaleko is an implementation of the "Unified Personal Index" - a system that gathers storage, semantic, and activity data from a variety of sources.  The goal of this system is to bridge messy human episodic memory with human storage (which is a mess).  Thus, a human might say "I'm looking for a file that I was reading about widgets, but I don't recall the file name, or when. What I do remember is that I had the most amazing momo that day. It was so good I posted it on IG."  In fact that episodic memory can be a high discrimination factor in allowing us to narrow the search: find the relevant IG post, which establishes a time frame, then use that to look at files the user accessed that day that had semantic content about widgets. Let me know if that makes sense and I can tell you what I'm working on today.


Applied patch in query/cli.py: Changed how Facets parameter is passed to QueryHistoryData to use model_dump() when facets is a DynamicFacets instance, preventing Pydantic validation errors.


---
Applied patch to:
- Reverted CLI conversion hack; now passing the DynamicFacets instance directly as Facets in history.
- Removed legacy list-of-dict support from QueryHistoryData.Facets; now requires a DynamicFacets model.


User confirmed they see the two entries in QueryHistory after adjusting DB.

Applied prompt condensation patch in nl_parser.py:
- Memoized available collections summary (`self.collections_summary`) and category schema JSON (`self.category_response_schema`) in __init__.
- Replaced the large dump of `self.collection_data` and schema with a concise list of collection names and the precomputed JSON schema.

Applied history-slicing patch in query/cli.py:
- Truncate RawResults, AnalyzedResults, and RankedResults to first 10 entries when building QueryHistoryData.
- Ensures history payload remains small (<100KB) even if full query returns thousands of results.

Added MultiProviderConnector to allow fallback across providers:
- Introduced MultiProviderConnector in query/utils/llm_connector.
- Added LlamaConnector stub for local llama_cpp or HTTP API.
- Updated IndalekoQueryCLI.__init__ to build a connector list: primary OpenAIConnector, and optional LlamaConnector if LLAMA_MODEL_PATH is set, wrapped by MultiProviderConnector.

Added AnthropicConnector:
- Created query/utils/llm_connector/anthropic_connector.py to interface with Claude via the anthropic SDK.
- Updated query/cli.py to import AnthropicConnector and include it in the MultiProviderConnector chain when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set.
