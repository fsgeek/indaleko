# Comprehensive Cross-Collection Dependencies Enhancement Plan

This document outlines the revised implementation plan to address cross-collection dependencies in our ablation study. The goal is to create meaningful relationships between all activity types and enhance the query generation and translation processes to properly reflect real-world dependencies across the entire power set of collection combinations.

## Background

Our ablation testing revealed that removing certain collections had no measurable impact on queries for other collections. Most notably, Task and Collaboration activities showed zero correlation (0.000 impact in both directions). This indicates that our synthetic data and query testing methodology do not capture the real-world relationships that should exist between these activity types.

## Implementation Objectives

1. **Create Comprehensive Entity References**: Establish shared entity references across all collections
2. **Enhance Query Generation**: Produce queries that span all collection combinations
3. **Improve AQL Translation**: Generate AQL with JOINs between all related collections
4. **Develop Meaningful Relationships**: Model realistic relationships between all activity types

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Implement Comprehensive Entity References

We need to implement a system that supports entity references between all semantically valid collection pairs:

```python
class SharedEntityRegistry:
    """
    Registry for tracking entities across collections to enable cross-references.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.entities_by_collection = {
            "Music": {},
            "Location": {},
            "Task": {},
            "Collaboration": {},
            "Storage": {},
            "Media": {}
        }
        
    def register_entity(self, collection_name, entity_id, entity_data):
        """Register an entity in the shared registry."""
        self.entities_by_collection[collection_name][entity_id] = entity_data
        
    def get_entities(self, collection_name):
        """Get all entities for a specific collection."""
        return self.entities_by_collection[collection_name]
        
    def get_random_entity(self, collection_name):
        """Get a random entity from a specific collection."""
        entities = self.entities_by_collection[collection_name]
        if not entities:
            return None
        return random.choice(list(entities.values()))
```

The `BaseActivityRecorder` should be extended to support these cross-collection references:

```python
class BaseActivityRecorder:
    """Base class for all activity recorders with cross-collection reference support."""
    
    def __init__(self, entity_registry=None):
        self.entity_registry = entity_registry or SharedEntityRegistry()
        
    def record_with_references(self, activity_data, related_collections=None):
        """
        Record activity data with references to other collections.
        
        Args:
            activity_data: Activity data to record
            related_collections: Dict mapping collection names to entity IDs
        """
        # Process standard recording
        recorded_data = self.record(activity_data)
        
        # Add cross-collection references if provided
        if related_collections:
            for collection_name, entity_ids in related_collections.items():
                self.create_relationship(
                    source_id=recorded_data["_id"],
                    source_collection=self.COLLECTION_NAME,
                    target_ids=entity_ids,
                    target_collection=collection_name,
                    relationship_type="references"
                )
                
        # Register this entity in the shared registry
        self.entity_registry.register_entity(
            self.COLLECTION_NAME.replace("Ablation", "").replace("Activity_Collection", ""),
            recorded_data["_id"],
            recorded_data
        )
        
        return recorded_data
```

For each collection pair, we need to define appropriate reference patterns:

| Collection Pair | Reference Pattern | Real-world Example |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Task+Collaboration | Task assigned in meeting | "Create documentation" task from "Sprint planning" |
| Location+Collaboration | Meeting location | "Team offsite" at "San Francisco office" |
| Music+Location | Listening location | "Taylor Swift album" at "home office" |
| Storage+Task | Task deliverables | "Q4 Report.xlsx" for "Quarterly reporting" task |
| Media+Music | Music video | "Billie Eilish video" for "Bad Guy" song |
| Storage+Media | Media storage | "Family vacation video" in "Google Drive" |
| Location+Media | Media capture location | "Wildlife documentary" in "Kenya" |
| Task+Media | Media for task | "Training video" for "New employee onboarding" |
| Collaboration+Music | Event playlist | "Office party" playlist with "80s hits" |
| Location+Task | Location-specific task | "Network setup" at "New York branch" |
| Task+Music | Focus music for task | "Deep work" task with "Lo-fi beats" |
| Location+Storage | Location-based files | "Conference slides" from "Berlin event" |
| Collaboration+Storage | Shared documents | "Project proposal" for "Client meeting" |
| Media+Task | Task about media | "Edit video" task for "Product demo" |
| Music+Media | Music streaming | "Spotify session" on "Living room TV" |

### 2. Enhance Query Generation for All Collection Combinations

We need to redesign our query generator to support queries spanning all possible collection combinations:

```python
class EnhancedQueryGenerator:
    """
    Query generator that creates realistic queries spanning multiple activity types.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Define templates for all collection pairs
        self.pair_templates = {
            "Task+Collaboration": [
                "What tasks were assigned during the {meeting_name} meeting?",
                "Show tasks with pending feedback from {participant}",
                "What action items came from yesterday's {meeting_type}?"
            ],
            "Location+Collaboration": [
                "Meetings held at {location_name} last {time_period}",
                "Who attended the {meeting_type} at {location_name}?",
                "When is the next team meeting in {location_name}?"
            ],
            "Music+Location": [
                "What was I listening to at {location_name} yesterday?",
                "Songs played during my visit to {location_name}",
                "Most played artists at {location_name}"
            ],
            # Templates for all 15 collection pairs...
        }
        
        # Templates for 3+ collection combinations
        self.multi_collection_templates = {
            "Task+Collaboration+Location": [
                "Tasks assigned during meetings at {location_name} last week",
                "Who's responsible for action items from the {meeting_type} in {location_name}?"
            ],
            # Templates for other collection triplets, quads, etc.
        }
    
    def generate_query_for_combination(self, collections):
        """
        Generate a query for a specific combination of collections.
        
        Args:
            collections: List of collection names (e.g., ["Task", "Collaboration"])
            
        Returns:
            Query string
        """
        if len(collections) == 1:
            # Single collection query
            return self.generate_single_collection_query(collections[0])
            
        elif len(collections) == 2:
            # Collection pair
            pair_key = "+".join(sorted(collections))
            if pair_key in self.pair_templates:
                template = random.choice(self.pair_templates[pair_key])
                return self.fill_template(template, collections)
        
        # For 3+ collections or fallback
        combination_key = "+".join(sorted(collections))
        if combination_key in self.multi_collection_templates:
            template = random.choice(self.multi_collection_templates[combination_key])
            return self.fill_template(template, collections)
            
        # Fallback: Create a query combining aspects of each collection
        return self.generate_composite_query(collections)
        
    def fill_template(self, template, collections):
        """Fill a template with realistic values relevant to the collections."""
        # Implementation with placeholders for all collection types
        
    def generate_composite_query(self, collections):
        """Generate a composite query that spans multiple collections."""
        # Implementation that creates sensible combinations
```

For power set generation, we need to ensure we test all possible combinations:

```python
def generate_power_set_combinations(self, collections):
    """
    Generate all possible combinations of collections (power set minus empty set).
    
    Args:
        collections: List of collection names
        
    Returns:
        List of lists, each containing a combination of collection names
    """
    n = len(collections)
    combinations = []
    
    # Generate all possible combinations (2^n - 1 combinations excluding empty set)
    for i in range(1, 2**n):
        combo = []
        for j in range(n):
            if (i & (1 << j)) > 0:
                combo.append(collections[j])
        combinations.append(combo)
    
    return combinations
```

### 3. Improve AQL Translation with JOINs for All Collection Combinations

The AQL translator needs to be enhanced to create JOINs for any collection combination:

```python
class EnhancedAQLTranslator:
    """
    Translates natural language queries to AQL with support for JOINs.
    """
    
    def translate_query(self, query_text):
        """
        Translate natural language query to AQL.
        
        Args:
            query_text: Natural language query
            
        Returns:
            AQL query string
        """
        # Detect collections involved in the query
        collections = self.detect_collections(query_text)
        
        if len(collections) == 1:
            # Single collection query
            return self.generate_single_collection_aql(query_text, collections[0])
            
        # Multi-collection query with JOINs
        return self.generate_joined_aql(query_text, collections)
    
    def generate_joined_aql(self, query_text, collections):
        """
        Generate AQL with JOINs for multiple collections.
        
        Args:

            collections: List of collections involved
            
        Returns:
            AQL query with JOINs
        """
        # Start with the main collection
        main_collection = self.identify_main_collection(query_text, collections)
        
        aql = f"FOR main IN Ablation{main_collection}Activity\n"
        
        # Add JOINs for each related collection
        for collection in collections:
            if collection == main_collection:
                continue
                
            # Add JOIN based on relationship pattern
            join_condition = self.get_join_condition(main_collection, collection)
            aql += f"  FOR {collection.lower()} IN Ablation{collection}Activity\n"
            aql += f"    FILTER {join_condition}\n"
        
        # Add filter conditions for each collection
        conditions = []
        for collection in collections:
            coll_var = "main" if collection == main_collection else collection.lower()
            conditions.append(self.get_collection_conditions(query_text, collection, coll_var))
        
        if conditions:
            aql += f"    FILTER {' AND '.join(conditions)}\n"
        
        # Return a combined result

            aql += f"{collection.lower()}: {coll_var}, "
        aql = aql.rstrip(", ") + " }"
        
        return aql
    
    def get_join_condition(self, collection1, collection2):
        """
        Get the JOIN condition between two collections.
        
        Args:

        """
        # Define join patterns for all collection pairs
        join_patterns = {
            ("Task", "Collaboration"): 
                "main.related_entities ANY == collaboration._id OR main.assigned_in_meeting == collaboration._id",
            ("Location", "Collaboration"): 
                "main.related_entities ANY == collaboration._id OR collaboration.location_id == main._id",
            ("Music", "Location"): 
                "main.related_entities ANY == location._id OR main.listening_location == location._id",

        }
        
        # Get the key in a stable way regardless of order

        if key in join_patterns:
            # Adjust the condition based on which collection is main
            condition = join_patterns[key]
            if collection2 == key[0]:
                # Swap the references if needed
                condition = condition.replace("main", "temp").replace(collection2.lower(), "main").replace("temp", collection2.lower())
            return condition
        
        # Fallback to a generic relationship
        return f"main.related_entities ANY == {collection2.lower()}._id OR {collection2.lower()}.related_entities ANY == main._id"
```

### 4. Create Meaningful Relationships Across All Activity Types

For each collection pair, we need to implement realistic relationship scenarios:

**Task+Collaboration Example**:
```python
def generate_meeting_with_tasks(self):
    """Generate a meeting with assigned tasks."""
    meeting = self.generate_basic_meeting()
    tasks = []
    
    # Generate 1-5 tasks from this meeting
    for i in range(random.randint(1, 5)):
        task = {
            "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
            "task_type": "action_item",
            "status": "pending",
            "assignee": random.choice(meeting["participants"])["name"],
            "assigned_in_meeting": meeting["id"],
            "related_entities": [meeting["id"]],
            "related_collections": ["Collaboration"],
            "timestamp": meeting["timestamp"] + random.randint(300, 1800)
        }
        tasks.append(task)
    
    # Add references to meeting
    meeting["created_tasks"] = [t["id"] for t in tasks]
    meeting["related_entities"] = [t["id"] for t in tasks]
    meeting["related_collections"] = ["Task"] * len(tasks)
    
    return meeting, tasks
```

**Location+Collaboration Example**:
```python
def generate_meeting_at_location(self):
    """Generate a meeting at a specific location."""
    location = self.generate_basic_location()
    
    meeting = {
        "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "event_type": "meeting",
        "event_title": f"Meeting at {location['location_name']}",
        "participants": self.generate_participants(2, 8),
        "location_id": location["id"],
        "related_entities": [location["id"]],
        "related_collections": ["Location"],
        "timestamp": self.generate_timestamp()
    }
    
    # Add reference to location
    location["hosted_meetings"] = [meeting["id"]]
    location["related_entities"] = [meeting["id"]]
    location["related_collections"] = ["Collaboration"]
    
    return location, meeting
```

**Music+Location Example**:
```python
def generate_music_at_location(self):
    """Generate music listening activity at a location."""
    location = self.generate_basic_location()
    
    music_activity = {
        "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "artist": random.choice(self.artists),
        "track": f"Song at {location['location_name']}",
        "genre": random.choice(self.genres),
        "listening_location": location["id"],
        "related_entities": [location["id"]],
        "related_collections": ["Location"],
        "timestamp": self.generate_timestamp()
    }
    
    # Add reference to location
    if "music_played" not in location:
        location["music_played"] = []
    location["music_played"].append(music_activity["id"])
    location["related_entities"] = location.get("related_entities", []) + [music_activity["id"]]
    location["related_collections"] = location.get("related_collections", []) + ["Music"]
    
    return location, music_activity
```

Each collection pair would have similar implementations, creating a rich tapestry of interconnected data that reflects real-world usage patterns.

### 5. Testing and Validation Approach

To validate our enhanced implementation, we need a systematic approach:

1. **Unit Tests for All Collection Pairs**:
```python
def test_task_collaboration_references():
    """Test that tasks and collaboration events reference each other correctly."""
    collector = CollaborationActivityCollector()
    meeting, tasks = collector.generate_meeting_with_tasks()
    
    assert "created_tasks" in meeting
    assert len(meeting["created_tasks"]) > 0
    assert "related_entities" in meeting
    assert "related_collections" in meeting
    assert "Task" in meeting["related_collections"]
    
    for task in tasks:
        assert "assigned_in_meeting" in task
        assert task["assigned_in_meeting"] == meeting["id"]
        assert "related_entities" in task
        assert "related_collections" in task
        assert "Collaboration" in task["related_collections"]
        assert meeting["id"] in task["related_entities"]
```

2. **Power Set Validation**:
```python
def test_power_set_coverage():
    """Test that all combinations in the power set have queries."""
    collections = ["Music", "Location", "Task", "Collaboration", "Storage", "Media"]
    
    # Generate all combinations (2^6 - 1 = 63 combinations)
    all_combinations = generate_power_set_combinations(collections)
    assert len(all_combinations) == 63, f"Expected 63 combinations, got {len(all_combinations)}"
    
    # Verify each combination has at least one query template
    generator = EnhancedQueryGenerator()
    for combo in all_combinations:
        query = generator.generate_query_for_combination(combo)
        assert query, f"No query generated for combination: {combo}"
        
        # Verify query mentions aspects of each collection
        for collection in combo:
            relevant_terms = get_collection_relevant_terms(collection)
            assert any(term in query.lower() for term in relevant_terms), \
                f"Query doesn't reference {collection}: {query}"
```

3. **Impact Matrix Generation**:
```python
def validate_impact_matrix():
    """Verify the impact matrix has non-zero values for related collections."""
    # Run ablation test
    tester = AblationTester()
    results = tester.run_comprehensive_test()
    
    # Extract impact matrix from results
    impact_matrix = results.get_impact_matrix()
    
    # Verify Task+Collaboration impact is non-zero
    assert impact_matrix["Task"]["Collaboration"] > 0, \
        "Task->Collaboration impact should be positive"
    assert impact_matrix["Collaboration"]["Task"] > 0, \
        "Collaboration->Task impact should be positive"
    
    # Verify other key relationships have expected impact values
    # ...
    
    # Visualize the matrix
    results.visualize_impact_matrix()
```

## Implementation Strategy

To efficiently implement this comprehensive approach:

1. **Create Core Infrastructure First**:
   - SharedEntityRegistry for cross-collection references
   - Extended BaseActivityRecorder with reference support
   - Enhanced query generator framework
   - Enhanced AQL translator with JOIN support

2. **Implement High-Priority Collection Pairs**:
   - Start with Task+Collaboration (previously zero impact)
   - Then implement Location+Collaboration (your example)
   - Followed by Music+Location, Storage+Task, Media+Music

3. **Add Remaining Collection Pairs**:
   - Implement the rest of the collection pairs
   - Add templates for 3+ collection combinations
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage of the power set

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Create unit tests for each collection pair
   - Validate power set coverage
   - Run comprehensive ablation tests
   - Generate visualizations of the impact matrix

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing this comprehensive approach, we expect:

1. **Complete Impact Matrix**: Non-zero values for all semantically meaningful collection pairs
2. **Realistic Query Behavior**: Queries that naturally span multiple collections
3. **Rich Synthetic Data**: Activity data with meaningful cross-collection relationships
4. **Scientifically Valid Results**: Ablation testing that reflects real-world dependencies

This enhanced plan will provide a more robust foundation for evaluating how different activity data types affect search performance, enabling more accurate insights into the value of each data type in a comprehensive personal information system.
