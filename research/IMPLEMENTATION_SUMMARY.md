## Design Notes

The ablation framework follows these architectural principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - TruthTracker manages ground truth data
   - Test runner orchestrates the testing process
   - Query generator creates test queries
   - Database manager handles collection operations

2. **Standard Indaleko Patterns**:
   - Uses IndalekoDBConfig for database connections
   - Follows collection naming conventions
   - Uses standard data models and patterns

3. **Testing Methodology**:
   - Systematic ablation of each collection
   - Measurement of precision, recall, and F1 score
   - Calculation of impact metrics
   - Summary metrics for analysis

4. **Data Management**:
   - Proper persistent indexes for performance
   - Transaction support for consistency
   - Backup and restore capabilities
