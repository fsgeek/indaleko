Future Ranking Enhancements for Indaleko
========================================

Potential ranking approaches to consider implementing:

1. Relevance scoring based on query term frequency
   - Analyze how many query terms appear in each result
   - Weight terms by their position (title/filename vs. content)
   - Implement a simple TF-IDF algorithm for document ranking

2. Recency-weighted results
   - Prioritize recent files with an exponential decay function
   - Create a configurable time preference slider (very recent vs. historically important)
   - Allow toggling between "most recent first" and "most accessed first"

3. User interaction history
   - Track which results users click on or interact with
   - Boost similar files in future results
   - Implement a simple "last N accessed files" boost

4. Content type clustering
   - Group results by content type (documents, images, code)
   - Show the most relevant item from each cluster first
   - Allow users to expand clusters of interest

5. Semantic relevance
   - Extract keywords/topics from results using simple NLP
   - Match query intent with document topics
   - Provide topic-based facets for navigation

6. Collaborative filtering
   - "Others who searched for X also viewed Y"
   - Identify common search patterns across users
   - Build simple recommendation matrix

7. Size/complexity metrics
   - Rank by file size, number of edits, or complexity
   - Prioritize more substantive documents
   - Offer "comprehensive" vs "quick answers" modes

8. Authority-based ranking
   - Rank files based on how often they're referenced by others
   - Identify "hub" documents that connect many topics
   - Build a simple citation graph

Each of these could be implemented as modular scoring components that contribute
to an overall ranking score, allowing users to customize which factors matter most to them.
