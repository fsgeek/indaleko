# Team 1: Data Generation Agent Requirements

## 1. Core Capabilities

The data generation agent should be able to:

1. **Generate Realistic Metadata Sets**
   - Create varied, statistically realistic file metadata
   - Produce semantically coherent content descriptions
   - Generate plausible activity contexts (location, device usage)
   - Create interconnected relationships between entities

2. **Target Specific Scenarios**
   - Generate data supporting specific query patterns
   - Create truth data with known characteristics
   - Support adversarial testing scenarios

3. **Database Integration**
   - Interact directly with ArangoDB collections
   - Verify schema compliance before insertion
   - Handle batch operations efficiently
   - Manage database connections and transactions

4. **Configuration and Control**
   - Accept parameters for data distributions
   - Control scale (number of records, relationships)
   - Support reproducible generation via seeds
   - Enable focused generation of specific metadata types

## 2. Agent Architecture

The agent should have:

1. **Modular LLM Backend**
   - Support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
   - Handle rate limiting and retries
   - Manage token usage efficiently

2. **Tool Integration**
   - Database query and manipulation tools
   - Statistical distribution utilities
   - Schema validation tools
   - File system interaction (for metadata extraction)

3. **State Management**
   - Track generated entities for cross-referencing
   - Maintain generation statistics
   - Preserve configuration parameters

4. **Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Monitor database insertion success/failures
   - Report on generation statistics
   - Identify potential issues in generated data

## 3. Domain-Specific Features

1. **Knowledge of Real-World Patterns**
   - Realistic file naming conventions
   - Coherent content relationships (related documents)
   - Temporal patterns in file access and creation
   - Geographic patterns in user behavior

2. **Targeted Truth Generation**
   - Support for specific test queries (e.g., "files edited in New York")
   - Ability to create controlled variations for testing
   - Generation of "needle in haystack" test cases

3. **Cross-Entity Coherence**
   - Generate semantically related document clusters
   - Create activity patterns that match content types
   - Ensure device usage patterns match activity types

## 4. Output and Evaluation

1. **Data Insertion**
   - Direct database population
   - Optional JSON export for verification
   - Generation logs with statistics

2. **Self-Evaluation**
   - Basic validation of generated data
   - Statistical analysis of distributions
   - Detection of potential anomalies

3. **Documentation**
   - Generation of metadata about the synthetic dataset
   - Records of truth data and its characteristics
   - Summary statistics for verification
