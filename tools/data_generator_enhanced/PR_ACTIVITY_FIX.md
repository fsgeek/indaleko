# Fix Semantic Attributes in ActivityGeneratorTool

## Summary

This PR fixes the semantic attribute generation in the ActivityGeneratorTool class, ensuring that generated activity objects have properly populated semantic attributes that can be queried in the database. It addresses a critical issue where activity objects had an empty semantic attributes list, preventing meaningful queries against activity data.

## Changes

- **Added _generate_semantic_attributes method** to ActivityGeneratorTool
- **Updated _create_activity_record_model method** to populate semantic attributes
- **Added helper methods** for generating random values
- **Created unit tests** to verify semantic attribute generation
- **Enhanced database integration tests** to verify the entire flow
- **Added documentation** explaining the fix and implementation details
- **Created cross-platform test scripts** to validate the changes

## Testing

The changes have been tested using:

1. **Unit tests** for ActivityGeneratorTool semantic attributes:
   - Verified attribute structure and values
   - Tested domain-specific attributes for storage and collaboration

2. **Database integration tests**:
   - Generated activity records with semantic attributes
   - Uploaded them to ArangoDB
   - Executed AQL queries targeting specific semantic attributes
   - Verified query results matched expectations

All tests pass with 100% success rate.

## Documentation

- **ACTIVITY_GENERATOR_FIX.md**: Explains the issue, solution, and implementation details
- **Patch file**: Contains code and instructions for applying the fix
- **Test documentation**: Added comments explaining test expectations and assumptions

## Related PRs

This PR is a continuation of the work started in the FileMetadataGeneratorTool semantic attributes fix. Together, these changes ensure that both storage objects and activity records have proper semantic attributes, allowing for comprehensive testing of the Indaleko query system.

## Impact and Risks

- **Impact**: Enables more realistic testing of Indaleko's query capabilities against activity data
- **Scope**: Limited to the data generator tool, no impact on production code
- **Risks**: Minimal, as changes only affect testing infrastructure

## Next Steps

After merging this PR:

1. Apply similar fixes to other generator tools if needed
2. Enhance query tests to cover more complex scenarios
3. Document the semantic attribute structure for data generator users
