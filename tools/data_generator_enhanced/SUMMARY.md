# Semantic Attributes in Data Generator: Status Update

## Overview

This document summarizes the work done to fix semantic attributes in the Indaleko data generator.

## Issues Identified

1. The `FileMetadataGeneratorTool` initializes but doesn't populate the semantic attributes list
2. The JSON serialization failed for complex types (UUIDs, datetimes)
3. The semantic attributes used inconsistent field names (AttributeIdentifier/AttributeValue vs Identifier/Value)
4. The lack of proper semantic attributes prevented database queries from working correctly

## Work Completed

1. **SemanticAttributeRegistry**
   - Created centralized registry for semantic attributes with UUIDs
   - Implemented consistent field naming (Identifier/Value)
   - Added utility methods to create and manage semantic attributes
   - Wrote unit tests for the registry class

2. **Database Integration Testing**
   - Implemented complete roundtrip testing (generate → store → query)
   - Added semantic attributes to generated objects and activities
   - Fixed JSON serialization issues with UUIDs and datetimes
   - Developed three types of queries (basic, cross-collection, complex)
   - Created detailed metrics and reporting

3. **Command Scripts**
   - Created cross-platform scripts (bat/sh) to run integration tests
   - Added command-line parameters for flexibility

4. **Documentation**
   - Created README explaining the integration test
   - Added patch file with suggested changes for permanent fix
   - Documented semantic attribute structure and usage

## Remaining Work

1. Apply the patch to the `FileMetadataGeneratorTool` class:
   ```python
   # In file_metadata_generator.py
   from ..core.semantic_attributes import SemanticAttributeRegistry

   # Add _generate_semantic_attributes method to FileMetadataGeneratorTool
   # Call it during object generation
   ```

2. Apply similar pattern to other generator tools:
   - `ActivityGeneratorTool`
   - `LocationMetadataGeneratorTool`
   - etc.

3. Additional testing:
   - Test with larger datasets
   - Test more complex queries
   - Test cross-collection relationships

## Testing

To run the integration test:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
./run_db_integration_test.sh --dataset-size 100 --debug

# Windows
run_db_integration_test.bat --dataset-size 100 --debug
```

To run the unit tests:

```bash
python -m tools.data_generator_enhanced.testing.test_semantic_registry
```

## Results

The integration test now achieves 100% success rate with all three types of queries.
Semantic attributes are properly added to both storage objects and activities, enabling
efficient and accurate database queries.

## Architecture Notes

This implementation follows Indaleko's architectural principles:
- Maintains separation of concerns
- Uses proper data models
- Follows UUID-based identification
- Uses standardized collection names and database access# Semantic Attributes in Data Generator: Status Update
