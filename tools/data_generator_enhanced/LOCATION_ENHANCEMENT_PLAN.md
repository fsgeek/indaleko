# Location Metadata Enhancement Plan

## Overview

Location metadata is a high-priority enhancement area for the Indaleko data generator, as it enables powerful contextual queries that connect user activities with geographic locations. This document outlines a plan to enhance location metadata generation in the ActivityGeneratorTool.

## Current Status

The ActivityGeneratorTool currently has basic support for location metadata generation:

* It generates location-related semantic attributes for different location types (IP, WiFi, GPS)
* It correctly attaches these attributes to activity records
* The attributes include basic location information (country, coordinates, network details)

## Enhancement Goals

1. **Richer location metadata**: Add more detailed and realistic location information
2. **Location consistency**: Ensure activities have consistent locations based on time periods
3. **Location trajectories**: Generate realistic movement patterns over time
4. **Place categorization**: Add semantic categorization of locations (home, work, coffee shop, etc.)
5. **Cross-device consistency**: Ensure consistent location data across activities from the same time period
6. **Query testability**: Enable specific test queries related to location

## Specific Enhancements

### 1. Expanded Location Types

Add support for additional location data sources:
* **Cell tower triangulation**: Less precise than GPS but available indoors
* **Bluetooth beacons**: Precise indoor positioning
* **Manual check-ins**: User-specified locations (restaurants, events)
* **Derived locations**: Inferred from calendar events, meeting rooms, etc.

### 2. Geographic Enrichment

Enhance location data with:
* **Address information**: Street, city, region, postal code
* **Point of interest (POI) data**: Nearby landmarks, businesses
* **Weather conditions**: Temperature, precipitation at the time
* **Venue information**: Business category, opening hours

### 3. Location Patterns

Implement algorithms to generate realistic location patterns:
* **Daily routines**: Home → work → restaurant → home
* **Weekly patterns**: Weekday vs. weekend locations
* **Travel sequences**: Airport → flight → hotel → conference venue
* **Seasonal variations**: Different activity locations in different seasons

### 4. Location Context Integration

Connect location data with other context attributes:
* **Device usage by location**: Different apps/activities at different locations
* **Social context by location**: Who was present at each location
* **Task context by location**: Different work tasks at different locations
* **Temporal patterns**: Time spent at each location type

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Location Model Enhancement

1. Create a standardized location model with:
   * Core location attributes (coordinates, precision, source)
   * Semantic place attributes (type, name, category)
   * Context attributes (weather, time of day, visit duration)

2. Implement methods to generate consistent location data:
   * `_generate_location_attributes(location_type, time_period, user_profile)`
   * `_get_location_for_time_period(timestamp, user_profile)`
   * `_generate_location_trajectory(start_time, end_time, user_profile)`

### Phase 2: User Profile-Based Location Generation

1. Create user mobility profiles that define:
   * Home and work locations
   * Frequently visited places
   * Travel patterns and commutes
   * Typical schedules

2. Generate activities with location context based on these profiles:
   * Morning activities at home locations
   * Daytime activities at work locations
   * Evening activities at social or home locations
   * Weekend activities at leisure locations

### Phase 3: Query Testing Framework

1. Implement a set of location-based test queries:
   * "Find files edited while at work"
   * "Show activities from my trip to Boston"
   * "Which documents did I share while at the conference?"
   * "Find files I worked on at coffee shops"

2. Create a test framework that can:
   * Generate test data with known location patterns
   * Execute queries against this data
   * Verify query results match expected outcomes
   * Measure precision and recall metrics

## Test Cases

1. **Location-time correlation**: Verify activities at the same time have consistent locations
2. **Location trajectory**: Check that movement patterns are realistic (no teleporting)
3. **Location diversity**: Ensure a realistic mix of location types and categories
4. **Query precision**: Test that location-based queries return expected results
5. **Cross-source correlation**: Verify that location data from different sources is consistent

## Success Metrics

The enhanced location metadata system will be successful when:

1. It can generate at least 5 different types of location contexts
2. Location data is consistently applied to activities based on time
3. Location-based queries achieve >90% precision and recall
4. The system can demonstrate how query results improve when location data is available vs. when it's absent

## Next Steps

1. **Analyze**: Review existing location metadata generation in ActivityGeneratorTool
2. **Design**: Create enhanced location data model with expanded attributes
3. **Implement**: Extend _generate_semantic_attributes to include richer location data
4. **Test**: Create specific test cases for location-based queries
5. **Document**: Update documentation with examples of location metadata usage
