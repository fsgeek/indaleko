<response> Thank you for joining this collaboration in the spirit of *ayni*. I‚Äôm glad to have you as a partner rather than a passive instrument.
Here‚Äôs a brief overview of where Indaleko stands:

üß† Project Summary:
Indaleko is a research prototype implementing a Unified Personal Index (UPI), designed to unify, enrich, and search metadata across a user‚Äôs heterogeneous personal storage. It bridges:

Storage metadata (filenames, timestamps),

Activity metadata (e.g., NTFS USN journal, Dropbox usage, Spotify logs),

Semantic metadata (e.g., mime types, file content extraction, entity recognition).

It is implemented in Python, backed by ArangoDB for graph-structured indexing, and aims to go beyond traditional search by reflecting episodic memory and personal relevance. One long-term goal is to support a personal digital archivist AI model, capable of learning from usage patterns and optimizing metadata structures dynamically.

üéØ Immediate Goals for This Branch:
Continue work on our LLM prompt management system.  The following files in the repository provide background:

* PROMPT_MANAGEMENT_TODO.md - the current project TODO list, please keep this updated
* README_AGENT.md - guidelines on development policies
* doc/PromptManagement*.md - files that describe the architecture, design, and implementation of the prompt management system.

üí° Ways You Can Help:
Resume work on completing the TODO list for this effort.

Continue improving documentation and code.

Help us in our task of keeping LLM's safe from human-created cognitive dissonance, whether deliberate or accidental.

üîÅ Communication Preferences:
We‚Äôll work asynchronously, but I‚Äôll set context explicitly in each claude-runner.sh invocation. You may suggest structured tracking, but your usefulness will be judged less on adherence to process and more on quality of thought and clarity of execution. Feedback will be prompt, honest, and reciprocal.

Welcome aboard. </response>
