- [x] Configure TTL index for automatic expiration (skeleton implementation)
- [x] Design JSONL processing interface
- [x] Plan direct collector integration

## Phase 2: Entity System Implementation

- [x] Design entity collection structure
- [x] Create skeleton for FRN to UUID mapping
- [x] Outline entity metadata tracking
- [x] Plan rename operations handling
- [x] Implement entity caching structure

## Phase 3: Activity Enhancement

- [x] Design importance scoring algorithm
- [x] Plan search feedback mechanism
- [x] Define interface for importance score updates
- [x] Outline transition interface to warm tier

## Phase 4: Query Capabilities

- [x] Design time-based queries
- [x] Plan entity-based queries
- [x] Design activity type filtering
- [x] Outline path-based queries
- [x] Define statistics generation

## Phase 5: Testing & Refinement

- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Perform performance testing
- [ ] Add detailed documentation
- [ ] Create sample data for demonstrations
- [ ] Optimize hotspots identified in testing

## Phase 6: Integration & CLI

- [x] Create basic command-line interface
- [ ] Add configuration management
- [ ] Connect with NTFS collector directly
- [ ] Create sample scripts for demonstrations
- [ ] Add support for batch processing

## Phase 7: Implementation Tasks

- [x] Complete service registration with proper IndalekoActivityDataRegistrationService
- [x] Implement database collection creation with proper error handling
- [x] Finish TTL index setup with optimal configuration
- [x] Complete JSONL file processing with robust error handling
- [x] Implement direct collector integration with proper event handling
- [x] Finalize entity mapping system with accurate path tracking
- [x] Enhance importance scoring with learning capability
- [x] Implement search feedback with database updates
- [x] Complete all query methods with proper indexing
- [x] Add robust error handling throughout the implementation
- [x] Implement efficient caching mechanisms
- [ ] Add telemetry and performance monitoring

## Phase 8: Testing and Verification

- [ ] Verify collection creation with ArangoDB
- [ ] Test TTL index expiration functionality
- [ ] Benchmark performance with large datasets
- [ ] Test entity mapping with real NTFS activities
- [ ] Validate importance scoring with real user patterns
