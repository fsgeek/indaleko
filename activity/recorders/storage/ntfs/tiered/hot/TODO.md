## Current Tasks and Remaining Work

### Verification Tasks

- [ ] Execute Verification Plan:
  - [ ] Connect to real ArangoDB instance
  - [ ] Successfully load NTFS activity data into database
  - [ ] Verify collection creation and schema
  - [ ] Test TTL index expiration functionality
  - [ ] Verify entity mapping with real data
  - [ ] Document verification results

### Testing Tasks

- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite:
  - [ ] Unit tests for all major components
  - [ ] Integration tests for database interaction
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks with large datasets
  - [ ] Edge case testing

### Integration Tasks

- [ ] Connect with NTFS collector directly:
  - [ ] Create integration between collector and recorder
  - [ ] Test real-time activity processing
  - [ ] Add appropriate error handling for connection issues

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Identify and optimize performance hotspots:
  - [ ] Benchmark batch processing capabilities
  - [ ] Optimize database queries
  - [ ] Improve entity mapping cache efficiency

### Documentation and Examples

- [ ] Enhance documentation:
  - [ ] Create usage examples
  - [ ] Document database schema
  - [ ] Add detailed API documentation
  - [ ] Create sample data for demonstrations

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Add telemetry and performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement transition to warm tier
- [ ] Add batch processing support for large datasets
- [ ] Create visualization tools for activity data

## Verification Plan

The verification plan has been created and is ready for execution. Key steps include:

1. **Database Setup** - Configure ArangoDB and verify connection
2. **Data Preparation** - Generate or obtain real NTFS activity data
3. **Data Loading** - Process data through the Hot Tier Recorder
4. **Database Verification** - Confirm data was properly stored
5. **TTL Testing** - Verify automatic expiration functionality
6. **Performance Testing** - Benchmark with larger datasets
7. **Integration Testing** - Test with Archivist and other components
8. **Documentation** - Create verification report

## Priority Tasks for Next Session

1. Execute the verification plan with real database
2. Test entity mapping with actual NTFS activity data
3. Verify TTL index expiration functionality
4. Create integration tests for the full pipeline
