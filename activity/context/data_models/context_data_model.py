    This class defines the data model for the activity context in the Indaleko
    Project.

    An _activity context_ is a reference to an object in our indexing system
    (database) that corresponds to a collection of activity data points that
    have been captured by the known activity data providers.

    Activity context thus captures information related to the users: what was
    the user experiencing at the time the activity context was created.

    Activity _data_ is an abstract concept that refers to the information that
    describes the experiential information.  Examples of this include, but are
    not limited to:

    - The user's location
    - The music the user was listening to at the time
    - The ambient temperature
    - The weather
    - The application(s) the user was accessing
    - The files the user was accessing
    - Other users with whom the user was interacting

    The activity context is a snapshot of the user's environment at a specific
    point in time. This information is used to help understand the user's state
    of mind, in order to enable Indaleko to more effectively assist the user in
    finding specific files of interest.

    This module defines the format of the data that is used by the Activity
    Context service.

    An _activity handle_ is a UUID, which serves as a reference to the data
    object ("activity context") in the database.
