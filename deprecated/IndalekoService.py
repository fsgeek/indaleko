"""
The purpose of this package is to create the information needed to track a
distinct Indaleko service class.  Registration and managemen is done in the
complementary IndalekoServices class.

        This class takes the following optional arguments:
        * service_collection -the collection to use for service
            lookup/registration.  Note that if this is not specified the
            database configuration will be used and the default collection is
            used.
        * service_identifier - the identifier for the service.  This is used
            to look up an existing service.  If this is specified, the service
            will be looked up by its identifier.
        * service_name - the name of the service.  This is used to look up
            the service if the identifier is not specified.  If the service
            does not exist, it will be created.  See Indaleko.Collections for
            known services.

        Note: there are two sources for this data: one is from program callers,
        the other is from the database, that's why we check two different
        values.  Ugly, but it is what it is.
