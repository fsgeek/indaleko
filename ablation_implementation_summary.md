# Indaleko Ablation Study Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive ablation testing framework for the Indaleko project. This framework enables systematic measurement of how different activity metadata types affect query precision and recall, providing quantitative evidence of each metadata type's contribution to search effectiveness.

## Implemented Components

1. **SQLite-based Truth Data Tracking System**
   - Created a robust schema for tracking studies, clusters, queries, truth data, and test results
   - Implemented TruthDataTracker class with comprehensive data management methods
   - Added reporting capabilities with detailed metrics and visualizations

2. **ClusterGenerator for Activity Source Grouping**
   - Defined six activity sources: calendar, music, location, environmental, cloud, and social
   - Implemented 4/2 split approach (4 experimental sources, 2 control sources)
   - Created both randomized and balanced cluster generation algorithms

3. **Enhanced Query Generation**
   - Developed template-based query generator targeting specific activity types
   - Added LLM-based query generation option using OpenAI or Anthropic models
   - Ensured balanced query generation for experimental and control sources

4. **End-to-End Integration Testing**
   - Created complete test pipeline from database setup to report generation
   - Implemented synthetic data generation for controlled experiments
   - Added comprehensive metric calculation (precision, recall, F1, impact)
   - Developed detailed reporting with metrics and visualizations

5. **User-Friendly Test Running**
   - Created cross-platform runner scripts (bash and batch)
   - Added command-line interface with flexible options
   - Provided detailed documentation and examples

## Architecture

The ablation testing framework follows this architecture:

1. **Study Setup**
   - Create a study record
   - Generate test cluster (4/2 split)
   - Create balanced test queries targeting experimental and control sources

2. **Data Generation**
   - Generate synthetic storage objects
   - Create activity records that match specific queries
   - Create non-matching activity records for baseline comparison

3. **Ablation Testing**
   - Run baseline query with no ablation
   - Ablate each source individually and measure impact
   - Ablate all experimental sources together and measure impact
   - Ablate all control sources together and measure impact

4. **Result Analysis**
   - Calculate precision, recall, F1, and impact metrics
   - Generate comprehensive reports with visualizations
   - Provide statistical analysis of metadata importance

## Key Features

- **Reproducible Testing**: Fixed random seed for consistency
- **Metric-Driven Analysis**: Quantitative measurement of metadata impact
- **Controlled Experiments**: Generated truth data with known properties
- **Balanced Approach**: Fair comparison of experimental vs. control sources
- **Flexible Configuration**: Command-line options for various test parameters
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed metrics and visualizations

## Next Steps

The following extensions could be implemented next:

1. **Multi-Cluster Testing**: Extend to multiple clusters for more robust testing
2. **Enhanced Data Generation**: More sophisticated synthetic data creation
3. **Advanced Metrics**: Additional statistical measures of metadata impact
4. **Visualization Enhancements**: Interactive charts and graphs of results
5. **Integration with Full Protocol**: Follow complete ablation protocol in Chapter 7 design

## Usage Instructions

See `tools/data_generator_enhanced/testing/README_ABLATION.md` for detailed usage instructions.

Quick start:
```bash
# On Linux/macOS
./run_ablation_test.sh

# On Windows
run_ablation_test.bat
```

This implementation successfully completes the high-priority tasks from `ABLATION_TODO.md` and provides a solid foundation for the complete ablation study described in `doc/AblationDesign.md`.
