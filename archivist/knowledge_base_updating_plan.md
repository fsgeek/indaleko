## 5. Data Models

### 5.1 LearningEvent Model
```python
class LearningEventType(str, Enum):
    query_success = "query_success"
    user_feedback = "user_feedback"
    entity_discovery = "entity_discovery"
    schema_update = "schema_update"
    pattern_discovery = "pattern_discovery"

class LearningEventDataModel(IndalekoBaseModel):
    """Record of a system learning event."""
    event_id: UUID = uuid4()
    event_type: LearningEventType
    timestamp: datetime = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    source: str  # Origin of the learning (query, user, system)
    confidence: float  # Confidence in the learned information (0-1)
    content: Dict[str, Any]  # The actual learned information
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = {}  # Additional context
```

### 5.2 KnowledgePattern Model
```python
class KnowledgePatternType(str, Enum):
    query_pattern = "query_pattern"
    entity_relationship = "entity_relationship"
    schema_update = "schema_update"
    user_preference = "user_preference"

class KnowledgePatternDataModel(IndalekoBaseModel):
    """A learned pattern in the knowledge base."""
    pattern_id: UUID = uuid4()
    pattern_type: KnowledgePatternType
    created_at: datetime = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    updated_at: datetime = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    confidence: float  # Confidence score (0-1)
    usage_count: int = 1  # How often this pattern has been used
    pattern_data: Dict[str, Any]  # The actual pattern information
    source_events: List[UUID] = []  # Learning events that contributed to this pattern
```

### 5.3 FeedbackRecord Model
```python
class FeedbackType(str, Enum):
    explicit_positive = "explicit_positive"
    explicit_negative = "explicit_negative"
    implicit_positive = "implicit_positive"
    implicit_negative = "implicit_negative"

class FeedbackRecordDataModel(IndalekoBaseModel):
    """Record of user feedback on system performance."""
    feedback_id: UUID = uuid4()
    feedback_type: FeedbackType
    timestamp: datetime = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    user_id: Optional[UUID] = None  # Anonymous if None
    query_id: Optional[UUID] = None  # Associated query if relevant
    pattern_id: Optional[UUID] = None  # Pattern being evaluated
    feedback_strength: float  # How strong the feedback is (0-1)
    feedback_data: Dict[str, Any]  # Detailed feedback information
```

## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 Learning Workflow
1. System captures a learning opportunity (query result, user feedback, etc.)
2. Create a LearningEvent record with appropriate metadata
3. Process the event to extract knowledge patterns
4. Compare with existing patterns for reconciliation or enhancement
5. Update the knowledge base with new or enhanced patterns
6. Apply the updated knowledge to future operations

### 6.2 Knowledge Application
1. Incoming queries are analyzed for relevant patterns
2. Matching patterns are applied to enhance the query
3. Results are tracked to evaluate pattern effectiveness
4. User interactions generate feedback for reinforcement learning
5. Pattern confidence scores are updated based on performance

### 6.3 Schema Evolution Process
1. System detects changes in data structure or entity models
2. Creates schema evolution records with compatibility information
3. Updates existing patterns to work with the new schema
4. Provides translation layers for backward compatibility
5. Gradually phases out obsolete schema elements

### 6.4 Integration with Entity Equivalence System
1. Learning system feeds potential entity equivalences to the equivalence system
2. Confidence scores from the equivalence system inform pattern relevance
3. Recognized equivalences enhance knowledge pattern application
4. Entity relationships discovered through learning inform equivalence decisions

## 7. Future Extensions

### 7.1 Predictive Knowledge Generation
- Use learned patterns to anticipate user information needs
- Proactively gather and organize relevant information
- Predict likely queries based on user context and history

### 7.2 Cross-User Knowledge Sharing
- Identify patterns that might be valuable across users
- Anonymize and generalize patterns for sharing
- Create optional knowledge sharing mechanisms
- Implement privacy controls for shared knowledge

### 7.3 Adaptive Query Optimization
- Learn which query formulations perform best
- Automatically optimize queries based on past performance
- Adapt to changing data distributions and access patterns

### 7.4 Multi-Modal Learning
- Extend learning to include visual and audio information
- Develop cross-modal pattern recognition
- Create unified knowledge representation across modalities

## 8. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### 8.1 Over-Optimization Risks
- **Risk**: System becomes over-optimized for specific patterns
- **Mitigation**: Maintain diversity in knowledge application and periodically explore alternatives

### 8.2 Privacy Concerns
- **Risk**: Learning could inadvertently capture sensitive information
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust anonymization and filtering for all learned patterns

### 8.3 Performance Impact
- **Risk**: Learning processes could impact system responsiveness
- **Mitigation**: Use asynchronous processing and resource throttling for learning tasks

### 8.4 Knowledge Corruption
- **Risk**: Incorrect patterns could contaminate the knowledge base
- **Mitigation**: Implement confidence thresholds and verification mechanisms for pattern integration

## 9. Success Criteria

The Knowledge Base Updating feature will be considered successful if:

1. Query quality improves over time as measured by user satisfaction and result relevance
2. System successfully adapts to schema changes without disrupting existing functionality
3. Entity and relationship understanding becomes more nuanced and accurate
4. Performance remains within acceptable parameters despite added complexity
5. Privacy is maintained with no sensitive information leakage in learned patterns
