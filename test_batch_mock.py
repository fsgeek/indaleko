INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING BATCH MODE:

1. Modern batch mode (recommended):
   python -m query.cli --input-file my_queries.txt [other options]

2. Legacy batch mode (alternative):
   python -m query.cli --batch my_queries.txt [other options]

Both methods will process all queries in the file without user input
and exit automatically when complete.
