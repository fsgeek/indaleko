## Summary

This report analyzes 0 ablation tests across 0 unique queries.

## Metadata Category Impact

Impact of ablating each metadata category (higher score = more impact):

| Category | Impact Score | Tests | Precision Change | Recall Change |
|----------|-------------|-------|------------------|---------------|

### Interpretation

## Recommendations

## Methodology

This analysis evaluates how ablating (removing) specific metadata categories affects search effectiveness.
For each test, we measure precision, recall, and F1 score with and without the ablated categories.
The impact score measures how much search quality decreases when a category is removed.

### Metrics Definitions

- **Precision**: Proportion of relevant results among the returned results
- **Recall**: Proportion of relevant results that were returned
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Impact Score**: Effect of ablation (1 - F1 score or F1 change)
