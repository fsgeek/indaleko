# Prompt Management System Implementation Plan (Updated)

## Phase 0: Pre-conditions and Tooling Setup

- Require `Python 3.12+`
- Install and configure:
  - `uv` for dependency management
  - `ruff` for linting and typing enforcement
  - `pre-commit` for Git-based validation hooks
- Add CI enforcement of 100% code coverage via `pytest-cov`

## Phase 1–3: (Schema and Prompt Handling — same as original)

[...unchanged from original document...]

## Phase 4: Prompt Guardian Implementation (Updated)

- Add contradiction detection rules and scoring
- Add PromptStabilityScore calculation
- Add LLM-based review using a separate reviewer agent
- Implement optional trust contract processing
- Store all issues and scores in verification cache

## Phase 5–6: Integration and Refactoring — same as original

[...unchanged from original document...]

## Phase 7: Monitoring and Optimization (Updated)

- Add stability trend dashboard
- Track token savings and verification latency
- Add alerting for low PromptStabilityScores
- Create dashboard panels for:
  - Prompt token reduction
  - PromptStabilityScore trends
  - Cache volatility
  - Review confidence scores

## Total Estimated Time: ~16–18 weeks


## Phase 0.5: AyniGuard Pre-Validation Layer

- Implement `AyniGuard` class:
  - Accepts full prompt dictionary
  - Applies contradiction checks across all layers
  - Computes `AyniScore` and returns structured result
- Integrate into `PromptGuardian` pipeline before stability or verification
- Log Ayni compliance results for all evaluated prompts
- Refer to `AYNISCORE_RUBRIC.md` for scoring policy
