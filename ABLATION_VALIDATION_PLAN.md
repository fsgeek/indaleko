# Execution Plan for Ablation Results Validation

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to implement and extend the validation system for ablation test results, ensuring scientific integrity and accuracy of the experimental framework.

## Phase 1: Implement Initial Validation Function

1. Add the `validate_ablation_results()` function to analyze_results.py
   - Implement detection for precision=1.0 with no true positives
   - Implement detection for F1=0.0 with false negatives > 0
   - Implement detection for perfect metrics with no matching activity

2. Integrate the validation into the report generation workflow
   - Add validation step during analysis of impact metrics
   - Create report section for flagged issues
   - Add severity classification for issues (critical/warning/info)

3. Enhance report output with validation results
   - Add summary count of flagged issues by severity
   - Add table listing all flagged issues with details
   - Include AQL queries from flagged cases for analysis

4. Create visualizations highlighting suspicious metrics
   - Add scatter plot highlighting flagged data points
   - Add histograms comparing valid vs. suspicious metrics
   - Add collection-level analysis of flagged issues

## Phase 2: Enhance Analysis & Testing

1. Create test script to verify validation functionality
   - Create test cases with known suspicious patterns
   - Verify all validation conditions are correctly detected
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions

2. Implement additional validation checks
   - Add check for identical queries between ablated/non-ablated runs
   - Add check for empty ablated collections that still return results
   - Add check for inconsistent metrics (e.g., TP + FP != result count)
   - Add check for metrics that don't match the expected collection pattern

3. Add advanced query analysis for flagged cases
   - Implement query parsing to identify potential issues
   - Check for missing collection references
   - Check for improper filter conditions

4. Create synthetic test dataset to validate fixes
   - Generate data with known characteristics
   - Create truth data with precise expectations
   - Run ablation tests against synthetic data
   - Verify validation correctly identifies all issues

## Phase 3: Fix Identification & Remediation

1. Analyze patterns in flagged issues to identify root causes
   - Group issues by common patterns
   - Correlate with specific collections or query types
   - Identify potential sources in code (query generation, execution, metrics calculation)

2. Document identified patterns and recommended fixes
   - Create detailed analysis of each pattern
   - Document root causes where identified
   - Recommend specific code fixes

3. Implement targeted fixes for common issues
   - Fix query execution for ablated collections
   - Fix metrics calculation for edge cases
   - Fix truth data handling

4. Create verification tests for each fix
   - Create minimal test cases for each identified issue
   - Verify fix resolves the specific issue
   - Ensure fix doesn't break other functionality

## Phase 4: Integration & Documentation

1. Update project documentation with findings and fixes
   - Add section to ABLATION_FIXES.md
   - Create detailed explanation of validation process
   - Document patterns of invalid results with examples

2. Create guide for interpreting validation results
   - Explain what each flagged issue means scientifically
   - Provide troubleshooting steps for each type of issue
   - Explain impact on experimental results

3. Integrate validation into standard workflow
   - Add validation to comprehensive ablation workflow
   - Make validation part of standard reporting
   - Add command-line flags to control validation behavior

4. Document the scientific impact of identified issues
   - Analyze how identified issues affect experimental outcomes
   - Document before/after metrics to show improvement
   - Provide guidance on interpreting historical results

## Implementation Timeline

- Phase 1: Days 1-2
- Phase 2: Days 3-4
- Phase 3: Days 5-7
- Phase 4: Days 8-10

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. All suspicious metrics patterns are correctly identified
2. Root causes for at least 90% of flagged issues are found
3. Fixes demonstrably improve the scientific validity of results
4. Comprehensive documentation is provided for all findings and fixes
5. The validation system is integrated into the standard workflow
