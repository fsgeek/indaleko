# Old NTFS Activity Implementation

This directory contains backup information from the old NTFS activity implementation
that was replaced by the new standardized storage activity collector/recorder pattern.

The new implementation can be found in:
- `/activity/collectors/storage/ntfs/` - Collector
- `/activity/recorders/storage/ntfs/` - Recorder

The old implementation was removed on $(date) to avoid confusion, but README files
have been preserved here for reference.

If you need to recover the complete implementation, you can find it in git history.
